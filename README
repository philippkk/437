hi

video game class projects will be stored here

good luck getting them to run

steps to dev on m1/2/3 mac

1. download both arm and x64 dot net
2. add x64 dot net to path
3. open vs code
4. open mgcb through vs code
5. should be able to rebuild content
6. replace x64 with arm version of dot net in path
7. restart c# dev tools in vs code
8. in terminal run `dotnet run` to build game
8. mgcb editor should still work : )

update:
actually just stay on x64 dotnet and it seems to just work idk
