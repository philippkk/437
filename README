hi

video game class projects will be stored here

good luck getting them to run

steps to dev on m1/2/3 mac

1. download both arm and x64 dot net
2. add x64 dot net to path
3. open vs code
4. open mgcb through vs code
5. should be able to rebuild content
6. replace x64 with arm version of dot net in path
7. restart c# dev tools in vs code
8. in terminal run `dotnet run` to build game
8. mgcb editor should still work : )

update:
actually just stay on x64 dotnet and it seems to just work idk

hi prof and/or ta :)
Heres what yall should know,
This golf project *should* meet every requirement as stated in the doc I will run through every single one of them after an explaination of how to play
### how to play
In the main menu, use the arrow keys and enter to select the option youd like
at any time press esc to close the game

#### how to actually play the game
when in the game, by default the camera will be in floating mode. WASD and Q/E to move
in order to shoot the ball, use the mouse to click on the tee area to place the ball, then press f to orbit the ball with the camera, then hold left mouse to choose the power to shoot at.
use Q/E to change the angle of the shot.
Two player mode is similar with the addtion of pressing enter to swap turns (be careful lol)

### actual implementation
1. there are two holes with the required implementation, for how they are loaded and unloaded see GolfCourse.cs
2. Click on the tee area to place your ball!
3. wide range of angles and power as seen by the ocillating power and angle decieded by look direction
4. yup
5. orbit and free mode 
6. total strokes 1 player and 2 player are maintained
7. sounds!
8. it is 3d, the blend file is even in the models folder
9. bepu 1
10. two player mode was so hard to make.
11. sure does! saves top three to a text file and maintains it
12. its messy but gets the idea across :)
